Yep, let's work!
Watching videos is mostly a waste of time. 
We are learning and really making some progress. 
New York is fun, we should really make some fun. 
Learning is fun too, we should make some fun. 
Once you work hard, the relaxing time seems worth it
and watching Jiejie would be more pleasurable than not working hard. 
You are earning something for yourself, not for anyone else. 
Take the time, take the resources and take your confidence!
